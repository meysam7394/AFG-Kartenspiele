# Card game in Afghanistan ( Bitrinu-3 card-Vying Games )
Afghanistan Kartenspiele Methoden -Bitrino- 3 card Game.
Betrinu - a three card vying game related to Brag.
Vying is the old English word for a process of betting on who has the best hand. When a player bets, or raises the stake, anyone who is unwilling to match their bet must drop out and abandon whatever they have staked so far. It is possible to bluff by betting on bad cards, hoping that the other players will all drop out. Most vying games are generally showdown games in which the showdown is preceded by one or more periods of betting on who has the best combination of cards.
By far the best known vying game worldwide is Poker, which has many versions.

*Initial Betting:
Players place bets without seeing their cards.
A "fling rule" determines how much a player can bet without reading their cards.




Card Distribution:
Cards are shuffled and dealt to all players without any player seeing their hand.


Game Progression:
Player 1 is the first to act and must decide whether to "fling" (bet without reading cards) or "read" (reveal their hand).
If they choose to read, they are given the option to "stay" or "exit." if first hand exit the second player has still the choice of Fling
if stays he can not fling because of first players rule.
Subsequent players follow the same pattern, reading or flinging and deciding whether to stay or exit.



Betting and Doubling:
Player 2 has the option to double Player 1's bet if Player 1 flings. Otherwise, they can exit.
Players continue the pattern, with each player deciding to stay or exit.


Hand Comparison:
If there are more than two players remaining, they receive a message to decide whether to reveal their hands to each other.
Players compare their hands, and the player with the best hand stays in the game.


Final Betting:
Remaining players receive a message about the total money on the table and are given the option to continue or request to show their
hands.
If they continue, they must pay the "stick."
Hand Showdown:
If a player requests to show their hand, hands are revealed, and the player with the better hand wins all the money.


Winning:
The player with all the money at the end is the winner.
It appears to be a game of strategy, bluffing, and risk management, where players must decide when to read their hands and when to stay
in the game  based on their card values and betting patterns.
